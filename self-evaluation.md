# Arrays Self-Evaluation
- So far, I am feeling pretty good about arrays. The string and number arrays are much easier for me to grasp currently than the Booleans arrays.
-I need to spend time learning about the shift and unshift array methods. I only practice the pop, slice, and push today.
-I was curious why I need to do the second console.log line with the pop and push, but not with the slice.
